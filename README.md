# The Problem

When customers first arive to the lot, they are unaware if a car is sold, for sale, or if the car is currently being viewed online

# What it does
We used Arduino to program the LED backlight. We got it to have three string values, one for when it is red (If the car is already sold) , 
one for when it is yellow (it is currently being viewed online), and one for when it is green(available for purchase). 
We found out that this is a very cheap option as it is easy to find bulk orders of LED lights. 
Also, every car in the database will have a QR code, so customers can scan it and see all the details of the vehicle. 
Additionally, users will be able to see if the Car is still in the Car Max dealership by going on the website, making it convenient for the users.

# Challenges we ran into
We were struggling with the LED light changing based on which vehicle is selected. We found the Raspberry Pi server was un-friendly at times and caused us a lot of hardships. 
Also a big challenge was implementing the SQL database with our LED, due to problems in Raspberry Pi. We ended up using arduino for our Grove LCD Backlight.

# What we learned
We learned a lot about Raspberry Pi, and how it functions. Also, how a database works and we were able to create a mock Rest API with vin numbers for every car. 
Also, we learned about teamwork, as this was not possible if it was purely done alone. 
Stimulating projects assigned in most companies, this also taught us real world applications and made us utilize our resources to accomplish the task at hand.
